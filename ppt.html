                    <div class="stat-card situation-color">
                        <h3>Situation</h3>
                        <p>Our inbound material receiving process was plagued by systemic manual inefficienciesâ€”not just missing paperwork, but time-consuming, error-prone data entry and physical verification for every shipment. This created latency and data integrity issues. And it had a complete lack of comparability to our newly implemented RTLS (Real Time Location Solutions) system. All of these means we had a digital disconnection, crippling our goal of end-to-end traceability.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="stat-card task-color">
                        <h3>Task</h3>
                        <p>My task, aligning with my role as Manager of Factory Visuals managing a SCADA platform and recourses like database and codes, was to assist architect a new platform. This required intensive collaboration with local engineering to lay out the end-to-end data flow and logical schematics, specifically defining: 1. The optimal technology and connection protocols (e.g., OPC UA vs. MQTT) to use at the edge. 2. The centralized data repository (MES DB) and its necessary structure. 3. The project time expectation and resource allocation structure. The final architecture had to ensure full integration of ERP data (e.g., Purchase Order data) at the edge and be inherently modular and scalable for deployment across other facilities.</p>

                    <div class="stat-card action-color">
                        <h3>Action</h3>
                        <p>1. OT/IT Architecture: oversaw the ISA-95 Level 3 integration layer to automatically capture and validate tag data from the edge readers with ERP. This ensured data was clean and synchronized across systems instantaneously. 2. Factory Visual & Efficiency: oversaw the design of the Factory Visual interface for the receiving station, creating an ultra-simplified HMI that required only a single RFID scan to complete all necessary transactions and simple manual entry for exception, virtually eliminating human error and all manual work. 3. Data Governance: Oversaw design of database tables to enforce new Master Data Principles, standardizing data entries comparable between the IIoT, RTLS, and ERP systems. 4. Drive Change: I support quick turn around with the multi-disciplinary team through pilot testing and training, focusing on demonstrating the time savings to the receiving staff to secure rapid consensus and adoption</p>

                        <h3>Result</h3>
                        <p>As a teamwork, the successful deployment of first stage resulted in immediate, strategic Value Creation: 1. Efficiency: We eliminated all unnecessary manual entry at the dock. 2. Acceptability: The solution's modular and scalable design was adopted by a few more sites globally. 3. Digital Continuity: The receiving data stream was successfully integrated with the existing RTLS, establishing complete, digital traceability for all receiving materials. 4. Data Intelligence: We incorporated and created some integrated 'Tableau' like dashboard.</p>
